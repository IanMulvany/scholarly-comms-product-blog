This blog has a focus on product development in scholarly communications. There is going to be a large focus on scholarly publishing. Product development covers a huge range of topics. I'm interested in **tools for product development**, **technologies that impact how we design and build products**, **business models and landscape changes** and **machine learning and AI**.


I've been blogging on a variety of topics for some time. This blog brings together some of my posts on the topic of scholarly comms.

If you have an idea you would like to see me blog about, or you would like to submit a post then please ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ianmulvany).
